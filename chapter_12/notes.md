Problem 12.11 can be easily solved by taking the results from Eqs. (11.170) and (12.29) for spin precession frequency and orbital gyration frequency, respectively.

Problem 12.18 can be solved by directly integrating Eq. (12.116) and noticing that integral for the spatial divergence part will vanish. The constness then follows.
