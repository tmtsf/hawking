Prob. 13.11

Magnetic monopole has a magnetic field in the form of Coulomb, with ze replaced by magnetic charge g, in its own rest frame. Now, in the electron's rest frame, the moving magnetic charge gives an electric field, with a factor of β. Therefore, the electric force between the electron and the magnetic monopole is in the form of Coulomb, with the equivalent charges of e and βg. Then, everything follows the argument in Sections 13.1 and 13.2.
